                <p>The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.</p>

                <p>The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. It can be used to access a DOM element directly.</p>
                <p><small>In this post weâ€™ll cover what the useRef Hook is, what we can use it for and some advice for using it.

                    The useRef Hook is a function that returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized with the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

                    const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);
                    There are two main uses of useRef that are explained in the following sections: Accessing the DOM nodes or React elements and keeping a mutable variable.</small></p>
